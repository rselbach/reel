# Reel

A lightweight macOS screen recording app built with Swift and ScreenCaptureKit.

## Features

- Record full screen or individual windows
- Optional camera overlay (circle or rectangle, configurable position and size)
- Microphone audio capture
- Configurable frame rate and video quality
- Global hotkey support
- Menu bar app with minimal UI

## Requirements

- macOS 26.0 or later (Swift 6.2)

## Building

```bash
swift build
```

Or use the included build script for a full app bundle:

```bash
./build-app.sh
```

## Why?

I made this because I wanted a simple screen recorder that does exactly what I need without the bloat in order to record quick demos/tutorials for teammates at work. It's a personal project to scratch my own itch, but you're welcome to use it.
